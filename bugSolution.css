To solve this issue, avoid directly subtracting pixels from percentages within the `calc()` function. One approach is to use a container with a defined width to help calculate the percentage:

```css
/* bugSolution.css */
.container {
  width: 500px; /* Or any fixed width */
}

div {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
  /* Now this calculation will be more accurate because of the defined parent width */
}
```

Another approach is to perform the calculation ahead of time, possibly through a preprocessor like SASS or LESS, or by calculating the pixel value and using that instead of the calculation within the CSS.  This simplifies browser calculations.

Choose the solution that best fits your specific project and design needs.
